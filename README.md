# One-Off Small Stock Analyses
This repository contains severall "one-off" small analyses related to historical stock prices, as described below:
* For an analysis computing and plotting the trailing 3-month and 12 month trailing returns for a small portfolio of stocks, stock indexes, and funds and showing each one's greatest drawdown (worst trailing return) over the analyzed period of record, see: [here](https://github.com/matthewebates/one-off_small_stock_analyses/blob/master/calc_3mo_and_12mo_trailing_returns.py).
* For an analysis calculating and plotting stock daily returns, fitting a Gaussian distribution to the mean and standard deviation of the data for each stock, and comparing that Gaussian curve of best fit to the histogram of daily returns to determine if each stock's returns are Leptokurtic (narrower than the Gaussian, indicating a greater chance of tail risk events), see [here](https://github.com/matthewebates/one-off_small_stock_analyses/blob/master/are_stock_returns_Leptokurtic.py).
* For an analylsis computing historical volatilities for a time series of stock adjusted closing prices, and calculating the correlation coefficient between that volatility and a time series of 21 day (i.e., monthly) trailing returns for each stock, see [here](https://github.com/matthewebates/one-off_small_stock_analyses/blob/master/calc_volatility_and_correlate_with_returns.py).
